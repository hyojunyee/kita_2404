Polar bears are directly impacted by climate change due to their dependence on sea ice for hunting seals. As global temperatures rise, sea ice is melting earlier and forming later each year, reducing the time polar bears have to hunt. This has led to decreased body condition, lower cub survival rates, and in some cases, increased mortality.

Document 2:
The loss of sea ice habitat is one of the most significant threats to polar bear populations. As the ice retreats, polar bears are forced to travel greater distances to find food, leading to increased energy expenditure. This can result in malnutrition and a decline in reproductive success, further endangering the species.

Document 3:
Climate change is not only affecting polar bears' hunting grounds but also their denning areas. Warmer temperatures and unstable snow conditions are making it more difficult for pregnant females to find suitable denning sites, which is crucial for the birth and survival of their cubs. This adds an additional layer of risk to polar bear populations already struggling due to loss of sea ice.

Document 4:
As their traditional food sources become less accessible, some polar bears have been observed scavenging on human waste or preying on seabirds and their eggs. While this behavior may provide some short-term relief, it does not replace the high-fat diet they obtain from seals, which is essential for their long-term survival in the harsh Arctic environment.

Document 5:
Recent studies suggest that if current trends in greenhouse gas emissions continue, polar bears could face extinction within this century. Conservation efforts are focusing on reducing global emissions and protecting critical polar bear habitats, but these efforts may not be sufficient if the climate continues to warm at the current rate.
